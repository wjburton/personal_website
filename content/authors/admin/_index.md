#bio: Hi, I'm Will! I've spent a lot of time over the years jumping from curiosity to curiosity in my free time and decided to create a website to start documenting some of my work. A lot of what I've focused onin the past has been around data science and robotics topics; From starting to build a self driving RC car, to tinkering with a raspberry pi as well as studying deep learning, information theory, philosophy of science and a bunch of data science topics.

Hi, I'm Will! I've spent a lot of my free time over the years jumping from curiosity to curiosity and decided to create a website to start documenting some of my work. In the past I've primarily focused on data science and robotics; From starting to build a self driving RC car, to tinkering with a raspberry pi as well as studying deep learning, information theory, philosophy of science, problem solving, and a bunch of mini data science topics.

In my professional life I have mostly worked in roles that allow me to straddle the line between the technical data science world and the business world. I find the technical details, techniques and algorithms fascinating, but I really enjoy being able to package it up into a form that can be easily communicated to help drive business decisions.
